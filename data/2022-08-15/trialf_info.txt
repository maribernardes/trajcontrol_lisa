** TRIAL WITH GELATINE PHANTOM #3 **
Did 1-2 extra steps at the end to compensate y error.
I think it is better to have fixed steps and ignore y error.

Phantom: #3 Gelatine (130g + 650ml = 0.2g/ml) with silicone sheet skin
Controller: MPC and Proportional

00: no compensation 	
00b:no compensation 	
01: MPC1		
02: MPC1
03: MPC1
04: MPC1
05: K=0.5 (mistake on K, was supposed to be 0.05)
