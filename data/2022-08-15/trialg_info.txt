** TRIAL WITH GELATINE PHANTOM #3 **
Didn't like the results. Big errors in Z with MPC
Think initial Jacobian is not appropriate

Phantom: #3 Gelatine (130g + 650ml = 0.2g/ml) with silicone sheet skin
Controller: MPC1

00: no compensation 	/ ErrX=11.9, ErrZ=3.5
00b:no compensation 	/ ErrX=10.6, ErrZ=3.04
01: MPC1		/ ErrX=6.06, ErrZ=10.72 
02: K=0.05		/ ErrX=7.10, ErrZ=0.4
03: MPC1 with H=1	/ Not a very good approach
