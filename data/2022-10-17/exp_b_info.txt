exp_b1: Phantom #1 - pink 90g
exp_b2: Phantom #2 - green 45g
exp_b3: Phantom #3 - green 22g

1) No Compensation insertions to characterize each phantom deviation after 10cm insertion depth:
	exp_b1_00a to h: Err 2D = 
	exp_b2_00a to h: Err 2D = 
	exp_b3_00a to h: Err 2D = 
	
2) Compensation: MPC3, w_ang=3.5, H=4
