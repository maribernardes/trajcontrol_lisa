** TESTING MPC FOR IMPLEMENTATION ERRORS - DO NOT USE THIS TRIAL **
Agar phantom would tear too much. Was not getting good pivoting (no controllability)
Phantom recipient was jiggling (round bottom)
Noticeable skin sliding (specially at phantom center)

Phantom: #2 Agar (80g + 1500ml) with silicone sheet skin
Controller: MPC1

01: Missed last step (implementation error)
02: Same as 01 (long stop)
03: Fixed code. Runs ok. Bad results. Check source of problems
