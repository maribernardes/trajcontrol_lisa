** INVALID TRIAL**
Used a fixed handcoded Jacobian by mistake. Was not updating J

Phantom: #1 Gelatine (125g + 500ml = 0.25g/ml) with silicone sheet skin
Controller: Proportional

01: K=0.1, safe limit=6mm / Wrong initial Jacobian
02: K=0.05, safe limit=3mm
03: K=0.1, safe limit=6mm
04: K=0.05, safe limit=6mm
