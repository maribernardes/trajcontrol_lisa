# Package: trajcontrol (version: trajcontrol_lisa)

## Overview
This repository contains:

- ROS2 trajcontrol package (see nodes and message exchanges in [Communication Diagram](#comm_diagram))
- Launch files for different control tasks for Lisa robot (see details n [Usage](#usage))

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To build system packages:
```bash
  colcon build --cmake-args -DOpenIGTLink_DIR:PATH=<insert_path_to_openigtlink>/OpenIGTLink-build --symlink-install
```

To run in debug mode, include:
```bash
  --ros-args --log-level debug
```

#### Registration procedure:
Collects sensor data at specific points (saved in 'files/registration_points.csv') and calculate the registration transform quaternion (saved in 'files/registration.csv'). However, we had better results using the 3D Slicer registration module to do the calculations from the registration points and then, replace the resultant tranformation quaternion at the registration.csv file

To run the registration procedure:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch registration
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol registration.launch.py
```
No experimental data is recorded, only the registration.csv  and registration_points.csv files.

#### Jacobian experimental initialization:
You can skip this experimental initialization and just use an arbitraty initial Jacobian (such as jacobian_geom.csv or jacobian_pivot.csv)
The initial experimental Jacobian is calculated and saved in 'files/jacobian.csv'. It is obtained by performing a shallow insertion (20mm) with a random sequence of lateral movements of the template (or predefined, to change, comment the code). 
The procedure uses the current jacobian.csv file (you can initialize it with values from jacobian_geom.csv) and updates it from the shallow insertion data. You might run this a few times (without reinitializing with jacobian_geom.csv) to decrease significantly the influence of the jacobian_geom values.

To calculate the experimental initial Jacobian:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch Jacobian initialization:
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol init_jacobian.launch.py insertion_length:=-20.0 filename:=NAME
```
Defining insertion_lenght(default:=-100.0) and filename (default=my_data) are optional.
In addition to the jacobian.csv file, all experimental data is recorded and as 'data/NAME.csv' as defined by the filename parameter.

#### Manually move the robot:
You may want to manually position the robot (in horizontal and vertical directions) using the keyboard. 

To use robot in manual mode, open 3 terminals:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch robot in manual:
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol manual.launch.py
```
3. Run keyboard node:
```bash
  ros2 run trajcontrol keypress
```
and use arrows from the numeric keyboard (2,4,6,8) to move robot up-down/left-right
No experimental data is recorded.

#### Move the robot to predefined positions:
You may need to move the robot to a pre-defined sequence of positions (waits 3.0s at each position before automatically moving to the next one)

To use robot in sequence mode, open 2 terminals:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch robot in manual:
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol sequence.launch.py filename:=NAME
```
Defining filename (default=my_data) is optional.
The file defined by 'filename' is a csv with all experimental data and is it saved as 'data/NAME.csv'

#### Move robot to a fixed horizontal position:
You may need to position the robot at a pre-defined X (horizontal) position with Z (vertical) in manual mode.
This is useful to perform the insertions at the same position with respect to the Aurora (and avoid parts of the measuring volume that are problematic).

To move robot to a fixed X, open 3 terminals:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch robot in manual:
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol init.launch.py
```
3. Run keyboard node:
```bash
  ros2 run trajcontrol keypress
```
and use arrows from the numeric keyboard (2,8) to move robot up-down
No experimental data is recorded.

#### Control the robot using the data-driven MPC lateral compensation:

To run the trajectory control with MPC, open 3 terminals:
1. Launch PlusServer with configFile 'PlusDeviceSet_Server_NDIAurora_1Needle.xml'
```bash
  sudo /opt/PlusBuild-bin/bin/./PlusServerLauncher
```
2. Launch robot in manual:
```bash
  ros2 launch trajcontrol mpc_step.launch.py H:=4 filename:=NAME 
```
Defining H (default=5) and filename (default=my_data) are optional.
3. Run keyboard node:
```bash
  ros2 run trajcontrol keypress
```
and use SPACE key from the keyboard to signal each insertion step.
Defining H(default:=5) and filename (default=my_data) are optional.
The file defined by 'filename' is a csv with all experimental data and is it saved as 'data/NAME.csv'
